We wanted to encourage the adoption of Ruby related projects by showing the potential of Ruby frameworks such as Sinatra, Padrino, Merb, Ruby on Rails, Jekyll, Octopress, etc.

So if you have any projects or sites that you feel proud of, please go ahead and send a pull request to our <a href="https://github.com/klxrb/MadeWithRuby.com" target="_blank">Github project</a>.
